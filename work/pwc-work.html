                                        <p>PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is the second largest professional services firm in the world, specializing in audit, assurance and tax consulting. While at YML, they came to us with several clear problems that they were having in regards to the influx of monthly support tickets around how accounts were verified.</p>

                                        <p>In short, in order for an account to be verified, the end user would need to go through an extensive process of completing several online forms that related to the countries that they were employed in. As you can guess, this varied per user and we immediately knew that we had to take a step back to understand the problem from the beginning of the customers experience.</p>

                                            <h1>Project Kickoff / Co-Design Workshop</h1>
                                            <p>From the start, we kicked the project off with a 1-day discovery workshop. Along with design activities such as sketching concepts as a group, the primary purpose was to also gather key insights such as the business/project goals and objectives, existing pain points/challenges, competitive landscape and a better understanding of the primary end user. Knowing this helped enable us to be better informed when we got into the conceptualization phase of the product design process. We interviewed with key stakeholders of the project to understand goals and pain points from a business level as well as common issues that end users were facing today on their existing platform.</p>

                                            <p>Fortunately, PwC had a plethora of data that they provided us. Based on the customer support data, it was apparent that there was a problem with the huge influx of support tickets relating to on-boarding and account verification. Users were essentially having issues just getting into the app for the first time and knowing what to do once they were in. Given that first impressions are huge and can make or break an experience, we focused heavily on the first-time on-boarding experience and account verification process, both covering about 90 percent of the entire experience. In addition, we wanted to better integrate PwC’s support department into the design, making them more accessible at relevant points of the user’s experience.</p>

                                            <p>1) User Onboarding (Verification / Sign up)</p>

                                            <h1>Other Challenges</h1>
                                            <p>Due to the global clientele that PwC had, the tax forms needed to “adapt” for consultants in countries around the world due to various tax policies. This added a whole new layer of complexity. Having to not only provide the user with a seamlessly guided experience through the forms, the forms also needed to adapt and surface relevant questions depending on the country the consultant worked in. So there needed to be a heavy focus on a more modular-based approach as well as detailed error handling.</p>
