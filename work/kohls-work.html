                                            <p>To understand the current state of how beauty consultants worked, we visited several Kohl's department stores. Notebook in hand, we interviewed over a dozen beauty consultants to get an broader understanding of:</p>

                                            <p>1) How they communicated with other beauty advisors</p>
                                            <p>2) How they managed relationships with their clients</p>
                                            <p>3) How they kept track of appointments they had with their clients</p>
                                            <p>4) How they provided immediate recommendations and kept up to date with current trends in the world of cosmetics.</p>

                                            <p>Immediately, we noticed the inconsistencies in how each consultant kept track of their clients as well as how they got their information and resources. Most of the consultants’ product information came from youtube videos which were done by well-known makeup artists and vloggers. It was apparent that there was no one centralized source of product information for all of Kohl’s beauty consultants.</p>

                                            <h1>3-Day Co-Design Workshop</h1>
                                            <p>After we conducted research we met with the Kohl's team to kick off a 3-day co-design workshop in Cupertino. The intent of the workshop was to gather business requirements and quickly bring the ideas to life alongside the key stakeholders for Kohl’s, the beauty advisors, Apple developers and the IBM team.</p>

                                            <h3>Day One</h3>
                                            <p>Day one consisted of initial introductions, gathering business requirements, understanding the overarching goals and understanding the “day in the life” of the end beauty advisors.</p>

                                            <h3>Day Two</h3>
                                            <p>On day two we mapped out the primary flow and sketched out concepts for each of the views that we would design. A majority of the day consisted of collaboration and presentations. Everything at this stage was still kept at low-fidelity.</p>

                                            <h3>Day Three</h3>
                                            <p>On the final day we worked with the visual design team to apply visual treatments to the wireframe sketches that we created. The workshop concluded with a final presentation and defining the strategy for execution moving forward.</p>

                                            <h1>Bringing It All Together</h1>
                                            <p>Over the course of several weeks, we conducted a workshop, interviewed over 25 people from the Kohl’s leadership team to understand their business goals and conducted field research with beauty advisors. The goal was clear, if we can empower the beauty consultant to make informed product recommendations by having immediate access to in-stock products and their details, there would be a higher probability that they would make a sale. And to add, not only would that customer make a purchase but there would be a higher chance that they would return, knowing that the consultant is there for them and can follow up.</p>

                                            <p>We knew we had to integrate with Kohl’s inventory management system as well as to store details for each SKU in a system. Working with the Kohl’s dev team, we were able to pull in the right data and design a simple UI that was made exclusively for beauty consultants.</p>
